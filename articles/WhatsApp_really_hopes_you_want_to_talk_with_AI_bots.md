Meta’s popular messaging app WhatsApp is testing a new design that gives prominent space to a suite of AI chatbots. The design, currently only accessible through the app’s Android beta, adds a dedicated tab for AIs on the app’s homescreen.

WABetaInfo spotted the change, which devotes one of WhatsApp’s four tabs solely to its AI features. It includes a selection of “Popular AI characters” to talk to, along with others organized by subject matter. Other AI-powered features within WhatsApp include AI-generated images and stickers and a search tool using Meta AI.

These AI tools and chatbots aren’t new to WhatsApp, though they’re only available in the US and certain other countries, and a limited selection of languages. They’re currently accessed through the app’s primary Chats tab, but this update looks to give them more prominence.

The app is also experimenting with expanding the range of AI bots by adding the option to create personalized AI characters, which WABetaInfo found in a separate beta update today. Meta already offers the ability to create custom AI bots, but only through an AI Studio on the Instagram website. Adding the option directly into an app is a significant simplification of the process.

The new AI tab replaces the existing Communities tab, though that functionality isn’t going anywhere. A previous beta version earlier this week introduced a “streamlined” version of Community creation within the Chats tab.

The WhatsApp beta is available through Google Play, though tester numbers are limited and the option to join is currently unavailable. We don’t know if or when the AI tab will be added to the app’s live build, but the change is likely to be limited only to those countries where the AI features are already available.
