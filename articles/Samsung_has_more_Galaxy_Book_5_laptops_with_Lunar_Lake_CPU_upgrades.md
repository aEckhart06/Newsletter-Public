Samsung has announced new Galaxy Book 5 Pro and Galaxy Book 5 360 laptops featuring NPU-packing Intel Core Ultra Series 2 Lunar Lake processors, following the Book 4 and Book 5 Pro 360 laptops it revealed in September at IFA.

Samsung says the new Book 5 Pro and 360 convertible diversify the Galaxy Book AI PC lineup with features like the Circle-to-Search-like AI Select app and an AI image retouch tool called Photo Remaster. These features appeared previously on the 16-inch Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360 and last year’s Snapdragon X Elite-powered Galaxy Book 4 Edge.

With their Intel Core Ultra 5 and Intel Core Ultra 7 Lunar Lake chips that have NPUs capable of 40 or 47 TOPs (respectively), they’re also capable of running CoPilot Plus features in Windows as Microsoft continues to roll out those experiences for Intel and AMD-powered machines.

The Galaxy Book 5 Pro comes in 14- and 16-inch variants, each with 2880 x 1800 resolution AMOLED screens and a 120Hz refresh rate. The Pros also have “Vision Booster” tech that “uses tone mapping to adjust the contrast and colors” to make things easier to see while working outside.

Samsung says the 16-inch model provides up to 25 hours of video playback per charge, while the 14-inch offers up to 21 hours. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Book 5 360 has a 1080p 15.6-inch AMOLED screen and lasts “up to 31 hours” while playing videos.

All three models have Bluetooth 5.4 and Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, one USB-A port, HDMI, and microSD card slots. They can be configured with Intel Core Ultra 5 or 7 “Evo” processors and either 16GB or 32GB of RAM. For storage, your options are 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. Pricing has not yet been announced, but all will ship to the US, Canada, UK, and other markets starting in February.

Correction, January 8th: A previous version of this article said these laptops feature Intel Arrow Lake processors. In fact, they use the newer Lunar Lake processors.
