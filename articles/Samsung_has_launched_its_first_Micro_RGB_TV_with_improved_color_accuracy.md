The 115-inch TV is debuting in South Korea for over $32,000, but Samsung plans to bring it to the US.

First teased at CES 2025, Samsung has finally launched a TV featuring the company’s new Micro RGB backlight technology. The 115-inch TV is first launching in South Korea for over $32,000, according to SamMobile, but Samsung says it’s coming to the US next, followed by a wider global rollout with more size options.

Samsung’s Micro RGB technology is being positioned as an upgrade to Mini LED backlights that employ an array of tiny white or blue LEDs behind a TV’s LCD panel. Micro RGB backlights instead use an ultra-fine pattern of individually controlled red, green and blue LEDs that are each less than than 100µm in size.

The new backlight is powered by Samsung’s Micro RGB AI engine, which the company says “analyzes each frame in real time and automatically optimizes color output for a more lifelike and immersive picture.” The technology allows for improved color accuracy and better contrast by precisely controlling the intensity of the individual LEDs, and Samsung says it can even boost the color in dull scenes, making them appear more vivid and immersive.

The other big advantage of Micro RGB is that the technology is cheaper to produce than MicroLED TVs. While Samsung’s first 115-inch model is launching at KRW 44.9 million – or around $32,362 – the company also currently sells a smaller 110-inch MicroLED TV in the US for $150,000.

Other features of the new 4K TV include a 144Hz variable refresh rate for gaming, AI upscaling, HDR10+ support, a 70-watt 4.2.2 speaker setup that supports Dolby Atmos, four HDMI 2.0 ports, a pair of USB-A ports, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. It can also function as a Matter controller, and if you use Philips Hue lights, the TV can sync their color to what’s on screen.

Samsung isn’t the only company pursuing this upgraded approach to Mini LED TVs. Earlier this year, The Verge got a demo of Sony’s awkwardly-named General RGB LED Backlight Technology, featuring backlight zones made up of red, green, and blue LEDs. And at CES 2025, Hisense announced its 116-inch TriChroma LED TV, which also features a backlight made up of individual RGB LEDs controlled by a new system the company calls RGB Local Dimming Technology. But while Hisense claims its TV can reproduce 97 percent of the BT.2020 color space, Samsung says its Micro RGB technology is even better, reproducing 100 percent and potentially making it one of the most color accurate TVs available to consumers.
