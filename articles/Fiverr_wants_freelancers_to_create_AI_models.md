The freelance service platform Fiverr will now let creators train AI models on their own work. Clients can then purchase access to custom AI models and generate content “with the speed of AI with the expertise of a pro,” the company says.

The feature is part of its new Fiverr Go suite of tools, allowing creators to “train AI exclusively on their own body of work, maintaining complete control over their creative process and rights.” Freelancers can edit and set the price for their custom AI models, which are available across services like voiceovers, songwriting, graphic design, illustration, copywriting, and digital marketing.

However, Fivver warns, “Due to the nature of AI, exclusive outputs are not guaranteed, and similar results may be generated for different users.” It also notes that clients will own the rights to “the final AI-generated content they purchase,” while freelancers can use the work generated to train their model (though clients will be able to opt out).

Fiverr Go also includes an AI-powered personal assistant that creators can use to answer client questions and gather requests. Fiverr says the model is trained on a creator’s previous customer interactions. The platform says only “top, vetted freelancers” will have initial access to the AI suite to “ensure high-quality adoption and results.”
