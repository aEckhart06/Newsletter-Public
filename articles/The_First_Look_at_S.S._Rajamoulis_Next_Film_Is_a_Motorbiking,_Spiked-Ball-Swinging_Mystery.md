The mastermind behind RRR, the incredible blast of a Tollywood blockbuster that caused an international craze, S.S. Rajamouli, is making his cinematic return. And while it’s not for the long-gestating sequel talk for RRR, the filmmaker promises a new icon set to speed his way across the world in his next film, seemingly potentially called Globetrotter, starring Telugu movie star Mahesh Babu.

In a clip posted to S.S. Rajamouli’s Instagram, we get a super mysterious first look at the movie, which admittedly is such a tease; we’re left a little confounded but excited by it. I mean, a motorcycle revs up on some ancient ruins, with pans that don’t reveal Babu’s look for the film. The anticipation is killing us because, in between shots of locations of an epic scale, sleek action, and a giant swinging spiked ball (Indiana Jones‘ boulder found rolling itself back into its cave), the title cards promise a “new magnum opus riding soon” and a full trailer we can’t seem to find! Don’t go to YouTube to try; you’ll find a ton of AI-generated “notion” concept dupes masquerading as the real thing.

Back in 2022, during promotion for RRR, Rajamouli described the upcoming picture as such: “My next film with Mahesh Babu will be a globetrotting action adventure. It’s going to be a kind of James Bond or Indiana Jones film with Indian roots,” the director said in a quote shared by The Hindustan Times. That’s definitely the vibe we got from this teaser, and we are already seated if we’re getting a kick-ass Bond-meets-Jones spy hero, served in an RRR-style multi-genre seven-layer-cake treat of a movie. The paper also noted that Rajamouli’s father, KV Vijayendra, was penning the script. RRR was based on a family story concept that mashed up two historic cultural Indian legends played by N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan, but here they channel action spectacle that also feels a bit like it has Mission Impossible franchise potential.

The poster for what’s known as Globetrotter touts a first reveal in November of 2025, and we hope that’s on an international scale.
