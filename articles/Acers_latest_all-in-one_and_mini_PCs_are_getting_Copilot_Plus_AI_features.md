Acer is revealing new all-in-one and mini PCs at CES 2025, and they’re among the first non-laptop computers to get Copilot Plus AI features.

The new Acer Aspire S AI all-in-ones, offered in a “minimalist white profile,” come in two sizes, according to a press release. The Aspire S24 AI has a 23.8-inch 1080p screen, and the Aspire S27 AI has a 27-inch panel in 1080p or 4K. You can get both with touchscreens, too. They’re equipped with “up to” Intel Core Ultra processors (Series 2), support Bluetooth 5.4 and Wi-Fi 7, and have an HDMI 2.0 port, two USB 3.2 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, and a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port.

The Aspire S24 AI will start at $1,199.99, while the Aspire S27 AI will start at $1,299.99. Both are set to launch in Q2 of this year.

Acer’s new Aspire C AI all-in-ones also come in 23.8-inch and 27-inch screen sizes, and both can be configured with up to QHD (1440p) screens. They’re powered by AMD Ryzen AI processors and AMD Radeon 800M-series GPUs, and you can get them with up to 64GB of DDR5 memory and 1TB of M2 PCIe SSD storage. However, unlike the Aspire S all-in-ones, the Aspire C all-in-ones only support Bluetooth 5.2 and Wi-Fi 6.

The Acer Aspire C24 AI is set to start at $999.99, with the Acer Aspire C27 AI starting at $1,099.99, and both are also scheduled to launch in Q2.

The Acer Revo Box AI is a new version of its mini PC line, and the company says this one “measures just 0.75 liters and weighs a mere 0.5 kg.” It also has Intel Core Ultra processors (Series 2) and can be purchased with up to 32GB of LPDDR5X 8533 memory. It will start at $799.99 and is also set for Q2.

In addition to supporting Copilot Plus features, Acer says these computers all have “Acer Intelligence Space,” which is “a central hub that automatically detects hardware and provides the appropriate AI tools to optimize performance, generate images, and enhance gameplay.”
