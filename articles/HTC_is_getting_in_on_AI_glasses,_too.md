With Meta, Google, Samsung, and maybe even Apple working on AI-powered glasses, smart spectacles are quickly becoming the hottest gadget in tech. Now, even HTC is jumping in on the trend with a new pair of Vive Eagle smart glasses that come with built-in speakers, a 12MP ultrawide camera, and an AI voice assistant.

The Vive Eagle glasses are currently only available for purchase in Taiwan, but they seem like a direct rival to Meta’s Ray-Ban and Oakley smart glasses. They come with AI-powered image translation, which lets wearers ask the Vive AI voice assistant to translate what they’re seeing into 13 different languages.

Other features include the ability to record reminders, ask for restaurant recommendations, and take notes (sound familiar?). HTC says its Vive Eagle glasses weigh just 49 grams, around the same as Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses.

The Vive Eagle glasses cost around $520 USD and come equipped with Zeiss sun lenses, with options for a red, brown, gray, or black frame. It’s not clear when — or if — HTC plans on bringing these smart glasses to North America or Europe, but Meta might have some competition if it does.
