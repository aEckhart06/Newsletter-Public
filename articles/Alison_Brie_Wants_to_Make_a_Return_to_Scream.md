Denzel Washington is keeping quiet about his Black Panther 3 role. David S. Goyer teases the origins of the Blob for its new remake. Plus, the stars of Resident Alien  hope for a movie to cap off the series. Spoilers, away!

When asked by Screen Rant about his rumored role in Black Panther 3, Denzel Washington only answered, “That’s between me and [director] Ryan [Coogler].”

During her recent appearance on the Shut Up Evan podcast (via Deadline), Alison Brie stated she, too, is open to reprising her late character in a new Scream movie but believes the “core four” characters of the last two films “need to die” already.

I hear tons of people are coming back. … I mean, Hayden [Panettiere] came back in [Scream] 6. Too many people live. The ‘core four’ needs to die. We killed [Jamie Kennedy’s Randy Meeks] in Scream 2. We should be down to two of the ‘core four,’ just by Scream 7.

During a recent interview with Comic Book, David S. Goyer, co-writer of the upcoming Blob remake, stated the titular monster would be “made in the lab,” the same as it was revealed to be in the 1980s version, though with the added wrinkle of “AI and gene editing and the slippery slope all that work entails.”

One of the decisions we made is instead of the Blob coming from space, it’s something that is made in the lab.

Speaking of the 1980s Blob, here’s an unusual clip from Chuck Russell’s upcoming Witchboard remake courtesy of Bloody-Disgusting.

A sleepwalker may be host to a demonic entity in the trailer for Dream Eater, a found-footage horror movie coming to theaters this October 24.

During a recent interview with TV Line, Chris Sheridan confirmed there’s “definitely” a possibility for future Resident Alien movies at USA.

When I got the official call that they weren’t going to continue the show, I did ask about that. I asked Michael Sluchan (who’s running Versant and heads up the USA folk) if, down the line, a movie of some sort or something, if they’d be open to it. He said yes. They’ve done a bunch of movies over there. They’ve done a few Psych movies. They’ve done a Monk movie. I asked them if they would consider doing one for us and they said definitely. You can’t launch a movie next week, but you wait a couple of years and I think the audience will still be there for it. I know very much the cast would love to come back and do something and I would definitely be open to that.

The story we set out to tell originally in the pilot, we have now finished telling, but it doesn’t mean there’s not more story to tell. Harry left in the last episode. When I had the choice of whether to have him leave or stay, I decided to have him leave for a couple of reasons, but one of them was, if he leaves, then it’s a great kick off if we do do a movie or something like that. Harry returns with some problem and people have to adjust. So I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a movie or some sort in the future.

Alan Tudyk echoed his statements, adding he has hopes for a crossover with the Predator franchise.

I would be open to a future of Resident Alien past this incarnation on Syfy and USA [Network]. I’ve been joking that Resident Alien vs. Predator would make an entertaining movie. You could do a mash-up there! I know that Predator seems to be having a resurgence, so I don’t know how willing they would be to mash-up with us. But there’s any number of stories you could tell, and who knows what the business is going to be doing. I think it just comes down to that. The reason we’re leaving is because the business is shifting, changing and figuring itself out for a minute. And when it figures itself out, if it gives us a call, we’ll pick up.
