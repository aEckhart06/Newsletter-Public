Who needs leakers when you can just show off your own next-gen foldable before your big devices launch? That’s exactly what Google has done. A week ahead of the “Made by Google” event on Aug. 20, where we’re expecting to see the heavily leaked Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2A, Google has dropped a 30-second teaser video practically revealing the Pixel 10 Pro Fold design.

Google didn’t share much else, but we already know how much the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will cost thanks to a previous leak. Per Android Headlines, Google is not planning to raise pricing for its new book-style foldable. It’ll reportedly start at $1,800 for 256GB, $1,919 for 512GB, and $2,149 for 1TB.

The name is still a mouthful, but look at the phone yourself and you might be asking, “What’s new?” That’s probably why Google is sharing the third-gen book-style foldable early—any changes, like a rumored IP68 rating, will likely be minor. But if you’re curious, Android Headlines leaked the purported specs: Tensor G5 chip, larger and brighter 6.4-inch cover screen (up from 6.3-inch), triple-lens camera (48-megapixel main, 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, and 10.8-megapixel 5x tele), 10-megapixel selfie camera on the cover and folding screen, a 5,015mAh, and a new 1TB storage capacity.

Instead of talking up the hardware, I expect Google to lean hard into Gemini integrations and how the phone is packed to the gills with ways to use AI to improve users’ productivity. It’s still early days, but Gemini is genuinely useful for mobile efficiency. However, gadget nerds—especially ones who own the Pixel 9 Pro Fold—may be disappointed that Google won’t be making sweeping upgrades to the foldable like Samsung did with the Galaxy Z Fold 7. I’ve now had a month to use the Z Fold 7, and it still feels like the Holy Grail of foldables. Every time I pick it up, I’m in awe of its thinness and lightness. The Z Fold 7 is the new global (it’s debatable if you factor in China and Asia-only foldables that aren’t available in the U.S.) book-style foldable by which all foldables—including the iPhone foldable that’s rumored for launch in 2026—will be measured.

Gizmodo will be on the ground at the Made by Google event next week. Stay tuned!
